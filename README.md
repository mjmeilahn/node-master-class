    2. Building Web App GUI

    3. Building a CLI

    4. Understanding Stability

    5. Understanding Performance

#### Course Review:
This was my first ambitious project tackling vanilla Node without NPM or package.json dependencies and literally know what is happening when a Node instance is being run and what moving parts are involved.
